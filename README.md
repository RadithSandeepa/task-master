# Task Master - WSO2 Code Challenge(2024)

Welcome to TaskMaster! Developed for the WSO2 Code Challenge 2024, this robust task management system showcases several advanced features and architectural patterns.

## Key Features:

1. **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Architecture**: 
   - The application employs the BFF architecture pattern to ensure a streamlined and optimized interaction between the frontend and backend services. This pattern enhances performance and provides a better user experience.

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: 
   - The frontend, built with React and styled using SCSS, ensures that the application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

3. **Email Reminder Component**: 
   - Using Ballerina, I developed a scheduled job component that sends email reminders for tasks due the next day. This component ensures users stay informed and never miss an important task.

4. **Authentication**: 
   - During development, I utilized Choreo's built-in identity provider for user authentication. For the production build, I implemented secure user authentication using Asgardeo.

5. **Database**: 
   - MySQL is used as the database to store and manage task data efficiently.

6. **Deployment**: 
   - The application is deployed using Choreo, ensuring scalability and reliable performance.

The project **Task Master**, created for this challenge, was developed with reference to the **CareConnect** project, which is showcased in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/a5anka/careconnect) and the associated [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/live/fdF4a51kPss?si=_TOS9-0iHXzY2DkL). 

While I used these resources for inspiration and guidance, the web application developed in my repository is my original creation. It was developed independently, leveraging concepts and techniques demonstrated in the referenced materials to enhance my understanding and improve my chances in the challenge.
