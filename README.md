#Task Master - WSO2 Code Challenge(2024)

## Project Overview and Acknowledgements

The project **Task Master**, created for this challenge, was developed with reference to the **CareConnect** project, which is showcased in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/a5anka/careconnect) and the associated [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/live/fdF4a51kPss?si=_TOS9-0iHXzY2DkL). 

While I used these resources for inspiration and guidance, the web application developed in my repository is my original creation. It was developed independently, leveraging concepts and techniques demonstrated in the referenced materials to enhance my understanding and improve my chances in the challenge.
